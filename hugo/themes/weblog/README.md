# Highly minimal blog theme

I'm migrating my blog from [weblog](http://henry.precheur.org/weblog/) to Hugo.

Mostly I just want it to look like it used to.  This is not a full-featured Hugo
theme, just what I threw together, good enough for me.

Parts are based on the [Codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/)
theme.

## TODO

 - Index redirects to latest post
 - Box next to heading linking to archive
 - RSS feed?
 - Email-me-on-new-article?
 - Anchor links to code blocks?
 - Show all posts at bottom of page
