Some [fuss][slashdot] has been made about Microsoft's [claims][ie9-blog] that IE9's hardware acceleration is architecturally superior to Firefox's.  Roc [says][roc] the IE team is wrong, and I believe him.

But technical arguments aside, I think there's a bigger story here. Microsoft is working not only to create a great product in IE9, but also to *convince* people that it's a great product.  Who would have imagined [two][chrome-release] [years][firefox-3] [ago][ie8] that Microsoft would seriously re-enter the browser market with a fast, standards-compliant browser?  And who would have imagined that Microsoft would so openly acknowledge that users' choice of browser matters?

This is a great success for Mozilla (and yes, also for Apple and Google).  We've forced Microsoft to compete on *our* terms.
