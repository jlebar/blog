I may be the only person who didn't know this, but Firefox can be configured to pass mailto: links on to Gmail, Yahoo! mail, or, with some work, other webmail clients.

See Preferences -> Applications -> mailto.

It might be cool if Firefox noticed when you logged into Gmail / Yahoo mail and asked if you wanted to change this setting.
