I just found out today that the Metrics front-end folks implemented one of my oldest feature requests for telemetry evolution: You can now create "dashboards" with multiple plots and link to them.

I've created a dashboard with some memory-related plots I care about at **[http://bit.ly/memorytelemetry][]**.

I'll try to keep that link up to date so you can bookmark it and always see an interesting set of graphs.

You can create your own dashboard by pulling up [Telemetry Evolution][], clicking the gear at the top right of the graph, and clicking "duplicate".
