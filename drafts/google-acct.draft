Over spring break, I decided to switch Google Accounts.  It was time to move on from the handle I'd had since elementary school.  (To keep spambots at bay, let's just say I was moving from old@gmail.com to new@gmail.com.)

In principle, this could have been easy.  I already had new@gmail.com set up as a forward to old@gmail.com.  I could just switch the direction of the forwards and be done.
