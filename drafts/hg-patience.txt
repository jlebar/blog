This weekend, I wrote a Mercurial extension which lets you create patience
diffs.  This brings Mercurial in line with Bazzar, which uses patience diff by
default, and Git, which has a `--patience` option on its `diff` command.

You can get the extension with

    $ hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/users/jlebar_mozilla.com/hg-patience

and install it by adding the following to your hgrc:

    [extensions]
    patience = path/to/patience.py

    [diff]
    patience = 1

This will cause `hg diff` and `hg qref` to output patches using patience diff.
You can also just run `hg diff --patience`.

Patience diff is an alternative diff algorithm [proposed][cohen] by Bram Cohen.
The problem is that the standard longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm
isn't ideal for generating human-readable diffs because it puts too much weight
on matching unimportant lines, such as blank lines, and curly braces.

Patience diff ignores lines which appear more than once in the input, so these
unimportant lines don't get matched in the diff.  The result is often much more
readable than a standard diff.  For instance, compare the following two diffs:



The Mercurial extension is currently something of a hack.  I'd love to know how
to make it cleaner.
